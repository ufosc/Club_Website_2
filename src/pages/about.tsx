          <h2>The Open Source Club</h2>
          <h3 style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>
            The Open Source Club (OSC) at the University of Florida is a
            community of makers who want to solve problems and improve
            our world through open source projects. The club was founded
            in the Spring of 2016 as an official student organization at
            UF. In 2017, OSC were founding members of the Mozilla Open
            Source Student Network. The purpose of the Open Source Club is
            to promote, support, and create open source software.
            <br/><br/>
            The club organizes casual coding, a twice-weekly meeting
            dedicated to working on open source code, planning or proposing
            projects, or just hanging out. Ocassionaly, it also hosts
            resume reviews, guest speakers from tech companies, and
            competitive hackathons.

          <h2>Why join OSC?</h2>
          <h3 style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>
            Joining the Open Source Club is a great way to gain experience
            for your CV and develop a strong project portfolio. Working on
            open source projects or leading a group as a tech-lead positively
            distinguishes you from other job applicants. We also host
            professional development meetings, resume reviews, and
            presentations from tech employers (IBM, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.).
            <br /><br />
            The club is also a fun way to meet up and network with people
            with common interests. We frequently host social events or
            hackathons for members to participate in.
