Open Source Club will meet for casual coding twice a week at 5-7PM, every Tuesday and Thursday. Tuesday meetings will be held in CSE A101, and Thursday meetings will be held in LIT0101.

Casual coding (CC) is when the club meets to collaborate on open source projects. During CC, members typically work with tech leads on club-led projects, do homework, or just hang out with others. Participation is non-committal, doesn't require applications/invitations or strict time requirements, and is open to everyone.

CC will kick off this Thursday (09/05/24) with our semesterly project pitch day! Members (new and old) will have the opportunity to pitch their project ideas to the club. Soon after, voting will occur on Discord to determine which projects will be worked on this semester.

If you can't make it to the first meeting, don't worry! You can still pitch your project ideas throughout the semester. Just join our Discord and post your project proposal in the #project-proposals channel, or come talk to us at CC! We are always looking for new projects and contributors.
