The first networking event of 2024! We hosted a "Hello, my name is" event Jan. 24 at the Career Connections Center (C3) to have a trial run before Career Showcase week. Career coaches helped us by acting as employers, providing advice and guiding us through first introductions (and the awkward handshakes).

We're here to help you get that first internship/job! The presentation can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gs2rKv-lrT4Al4iscFxJrs6SThrDQbvF/view">here</a>. Also, our resume review channel on <a href="https://discord.gg/Gsxej6u">Discord</a> is another great resource.
