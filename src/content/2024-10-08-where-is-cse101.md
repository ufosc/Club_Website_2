CSE A101 is located at the University of Florida's Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) building. CSE A101 is home to UF's Open Source Club Casual Coding sessions on Tuesday (for more information, see: [Fall 2024 Casual Coding](/blog/2024-fall-casual-coding/)). This article covers how to find and make your way to CSE A101.

The Computer Science & Engineering building (see its location on the UF campus map [here](https://campusmap.ufl.edu/#/index/0042)) is located by the Marston Science library. The most convenient route to CSE A101 is from Turlington plaza heading towards Marston library. Alternatively, you may approach from the hub (Reitz Union Lawn) and head towards Marston.

On approaching from Turlington Plaza, head towards the Marston Science Library. The door to the UF CSE building will be located opposite the Marston library entrance (refer to the picture above). Once you enter, take the stairs to the basement floor and exit the building through the door directly in front of the stairs. CSEA101 will be located directly opposite the main CSE building (from which you've exited).
