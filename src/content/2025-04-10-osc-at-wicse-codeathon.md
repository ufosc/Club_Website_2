On April 29th, 2025, the Women in Computer Science and Engineering (WICSE) held their annual Code-a-thon. This event marks the day of the year where middle and high schoolers are invited onto UF campus to be exposed to a variety of computing topics. From quantum computing to cybersecurity, there was no shortage of topics to learn. To support WICSE's endeavor and to provide the kids with an incredible experience, high-profile OSC members enlisted to attend and host the most essential workshop...

## **Introduction to HTML & CSS!**

OSC's workshop of valuable front-end technologies had one goal and one plan. The goal: turn the kids into incoming software engineers at Google. The plan: explain what HTML and CSS even is, and have them make their own website with nothing but a computer, VS Code, and pure imagination. The scope of the workshop was kept small, only introducing barebone-yet-essential elements of HTML, and a very brief introduction into how styling works with CSS. A delicate balance had to be made, ensuring that the workshop taught enough without going too far with concepts so that kids with no programming experience can follow along.

Throughout 8 hours of blood, sweat, and tears, OSC mentored dozens of aspiring webdevs and pushed them towards the very limits of their creativity and imagination. The result? Nearly 30 custom-made webpages each rich in character that reflects the student. Each portfolio made signifies its creator, giving a firsthand look at who the student is at their core. One student dedicated their webpage to the truth of life, jumping straight into asking the question of, "Who are you?" Two students, best friends with each other, made a small webpage with a picture of food and a message dedicated to how much they love each other. Another student dedicated his webpage towards Anton, Wilson, and Michelle, declaring them the most handsome and beautiful people ever. One last student made a page all about Oreos, declaring that he will return to make one about Chips Ahoy next year.

This year's code-a-thon marked OSC's first, and the event ended with the quiet yet firm determination of returning again next year. Expectations were moderate going into the event, with the main idea of helping out a fellow student organization and having fun teaching kids. The code-a-thon far exceeded those expectations, enriching the members who volunteered with an unforgettable experience and the warm embrace of satisfaction. It became more than just volunteering and giving back to the community, but about following one of OSC's most important principles: having fun. The kids were not being career prepped into software industry, but were given the tools and creative freedom to have fun. All of them had fun making their websites, and OSC had fun helping them. Anton Salvador, president of OSC, attended the code-a-thon and had this to say:

> I've been in OSC for 3 years and this has easily been one of the most rewarding things I have done. Being able to teach all of the kids and seeing them so happy, taking pictures of their sites, adding anything from Shrek to dinosaurs, and learning to love coding, there truly isnâ€™t anything like it. I hope OSC will continue to do this event for years to come.

As OSC's first time going, it was an incredible experience. We are excited to come back next semester, improving on our workshop to deliver yet another life-changing experience to our aspiring front end legends.
