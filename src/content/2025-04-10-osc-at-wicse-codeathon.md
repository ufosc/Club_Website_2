subtitle: OSC hosts web development workshop at the annual Women in Computer Science & Engineering (WiCSE) Code-A-Thon

On March 29th, 2025, the University of Florida's [Women in Computer Science & Engineering](https://ufwicse.com/) (WiCSE) club hosted their annual Code-A-Thon, an event where middle/high schoolers could participate in workshops led by University of Florida student organizations. From quantum computing to competitive programming and cybersecurity, there was no shortage of topics to explore. Renowned for its energy and unrelenting commitment to public good, the UF Open Source Club (OSC) invested its members towards participating in the event.

At first glance, other workshop groups seemed to be in complete disarray, causing panic to spread among the volunteers and WiCSE board members. Workshop organizers struggled with equipment and setting up software; success was uncertain and the nearer the time came, the more nervous everyone grew. There were some who expressed the opinion that it was not in WiCSE's own interest to lead workshops of such immense scale and magnitude. Rumors of cancellation were exchanged among the ranks of participants, and these filled the organizers with dread. Anton Salvador, president of OSC, intervened on behalf of the volunteers: he reassured WiCSE that the breadth of OSC's knowledge and experience was not to be doubted. He received the organizers' supplications with open arms and made sure everyone's concerns were addressed. After doing so, he reprimanded volunteers for spreading panic and uncertainty, and reminded them of the past ferocity and vigor of OSC volunteers in overcoming challenges.

Once everyone's confidence was restored, UF OSC went on to lead 6 workshops over an 8 hour period. Participants were guided through open source principles and a wide spectrum of web development technologies; participant websites have since been published and are available [here](https://ufosc.github.io/wicse-codeathon-2025). Overall, the event was a massive success and serves as testament to OSC's perseverance and intensity in overcoming challenges.

OSC extends its gratitude to UF WiCSE for their fearless leadership, unwavering dedication, and for entrusting us with the opportunity to help inspire the next generation of web developers. Follow WiCSE on Instagram here: [@uf.wicse](https://www.instagram.com/uf.wicse/).

## **Introduction to HTML & CSS!**

OSC's workshop of valuable front-end technologies had one goal and one plan. The goal: turn the kids into incoming software engineers at Google. The plan: explain what HTML and CSS even is, and have them make their own website with nothing but a computer, VS Code, and pure imagination. Time limits and constraints set aside, the participants were introduced to technologies across the whole web development spectrum: HTML, CSS styling, optimization, animation, dynamic forms, among others. OSC sought to strike a delicate balance, accelerating the learning of talented participants, without discouraging those with no programming experience.

Throughout 8 hours of blood, sweat, and tears, OSC mentored dozens of aspiring webdevs and pushed them towards the very limits of their creativity and imagination. The result? Nearly 30 custom-made webpages each rich in character that reflects the student. Each portfolio made signifies its creator, giving a firsthand look at who the student is at their core. One student dedicated their webpage to the truth of life, jumping straight into asking the question of, "Who are you?" Two students, best friends with each other, made a small webpage with a picture of food and a message dedicated to how much they love each other. Another student dedicated his webpage towards Anton, Wilson, and Michelle, declaring them the most handsome and beautiful people ever. One last student made a page all about Oreos, declaring that he will return to make one about Chips Ahoy next year.

This year's code-a-thon marked OSC's first, and the event ended with the quiet yet firm determination of returning again next year. Expectations were moderate going into the event, with the main idea of helping out a fellow student organization and having fun teaching kids. The code-a-thon far exceeded those expectations, enriching the members who volunteered with an unforgettable experience and the warm embrace of satisfaction. It became more than just volunteering and giving back to the community, but about following one of OSC's most important principles: having fun. The kids were not being career prepped into software industry, but were given the tools and creative freedom to have fun. All of them had fun making their websites, and OSC had fun helping them. Anton Salvador, president of OSC, attended the code-a-thon and had this to say:

> I've been in OSC for 3 years and this has easily been one of the most rewarding things I have done. Being able to teach all of the kids and seeing them so happy, taking pictures of their sites, adding anything from Shrek to dinosaurs, and learning to love coding, there truly isnâ€™t anything like it. I hope OSC will continue to do this event for years to come.

As OSC's first time attending, it was an incredible experience. We are excited to come back next semester, improving on our workshop to deliver yet another life-changing experience to our aspiring front end legends.
