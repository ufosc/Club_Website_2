subtitle: OSC hosts web development workshop at the annual Women in Computer Science & Engineering (WiCSE) Code-A-Thon

On March 29th, 2025, the University of Florida's [Women in Computer Science & Engineering](https://ufwicse.com/) (UF WiCSE) club hosted their annual Code-A-Thon, an event where middle and high schoolers could participate in workshops led by University of Florida student organizations. From quantum computing to competitive programming and cybersecurity, there was no shortage of topics to explore. Renowned for its energy and unrelenting commitment to public good, the UF Open Source Club (OSC) invested its most high-profile members towards participating in the event.

Going into the event, tensions were high. It wasn't just teaching kids how to code. It was inspiring the next generation of society into potentially becoming the next big wave in the computing industry. It felt like the slightest mistake meant devastating failure. Other organizations didn't seem to buckle under the weight; some, having been around before, knew what was to come and had a full year to prepare their wits. WiCSE, being the organizers of it all, seemed the most confident, leading and organizing everyone with great efficiency. As OSC's first time around, it may have seemed that OSC would fall behind from the other organizations due to the lack of experience. However, the elite among elite of OSC, selected by President Anton Salvador, were not to be trifled. In spite of the lack of experience, none of them felt a shred of anxiety. For it was in OSC's style to break past expectations and run in headfirst towards any challenge. In the name of friendly competition, OSC would strive to leave the greatest impact among all volunteering organizations, a tall and arduous task most would deem impossible. But not impossible for OSC.

As the clock struck 9:00 AM and the kids were thrown into their groups and rotations, OSC would lead a total of 6 workshop sessions over an 8 hour period. As for the workshop held, OSC tackled on teaching one of the most essential subjects...

## **Introduction to HTML & CSS!**

OSC's workshop of valuable front-end technologies had one goal and one plan. The goal: turn the kids into incoming software engineers at Google. The plan: explain what HTML and CSS even is, and have them make their own website with nothing but a computer, VS Code, and pure imagination. Time limits and constraints set aside, the participants were introduced to technologies across the whole web development spectrum: HTML, CSS styling, optimization, animation, dynamic forms, among others. OSC sought to strike a delicate balance, accelerating the learning of talented participants, without discouraging those with no programming experience.

Throughout 8 hours of blood, sweat, and tears, OSC mentored dozens of aspiring webdevs and pushed them towards the very limits of their creativity and imagination. The result? Nearly 30 custom-made webpages each rich in character that reflects the student. Each portfolio made signifies its creator, giving a firsthand look at who the student is at their core. One student dedicated their webpage to the truth of life, jumping straight into asking the question of, "Who are you?" Two students, best friends with each other, made a small webpage with a picture of food and a message dedicated to how much they love each other. Another student dedicated his webpage towards Anton, Wilson, and Michelle, declaring them the most handsome and beautiful people ever. One last student made a page all about Oreos, declaring that he will return to make one about Chips Ahoy next year.

This year's code-a-thon marked OSC's first, and the event ended with the quiet yet firm determination of returning again next year. Expectations were moderate going into the event, with the main idea of helping out a fellow student organization and having fun teaching kids. The code-a-thon far exceeded those expectations, enriching the members who volunteered with an unforgettable experience and the warm embrace of satisfaction. It became more than just volunteering and giving back to the community, but about following one of OSC's most important principles: having fun. The kids were not being career prepped into software industry, but were given the tools and creative freedom to have fun. All of them had fun making their websites, and OSC had fun helping them. Anton Salvador, president of OSC, attended the code-a-thon and had this to say:

> I've been in OSC for 3 years and this has easily been one of the most rewarding things I have ever done. Being able to teach all of the kids and seeing them so happy, taking pictures of their sites, adding anything from Shrek to dinosaurs and Chips Ahoy, and learning to love coding, there truly isnâ€™t anything like it. I hope OSC will continue to do this event for years to come.

The event was a massive success, and stood as a testament of OSC's perseverance and determination in overcoming any challenge. OSC extends its gratitude to UF WiCSE ([@uf.wicse](https://www.instagram.com/uf.wicse/)) for their strong leadership, unwavering dedication, and for inviting us and letting us inspire the next generation of web developers. If we're back next year, OSC can guarantee that we will deliver yet another life-changing experience to all our young and aspiring front-end legends.
