Open Source Club will meet for casual coding twice a week, every Tuesday and Thursday at 5-7PM in TUR L011.

Casual coding (CC) is when the club meets to collaborate on open source projects. During CC, members typically work with tech leads on club-led projects, do homework, or just hang out with others. Participation is non-committal, doesn't require applications/invitations or strict time requirements, and is open to everyone.

This coming Thursday (01/18/24), we'll be meeting to discuss projects to work on for the remainder of the semester. Voting for projects will be announced on Discord shortly after.
