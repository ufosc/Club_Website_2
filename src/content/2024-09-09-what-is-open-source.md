subtitle: What is the meaning of Open Source Software?
---

Open Source Software (OSS) refers to software that is distributed with its source code, allowing anyone to view, modify, distribute, and enhance it. This model fosters collaborative development, where communities of developers across the globe contribute to creating and improving software. The principles of openness, transparency, and collective effort underpin the open source movement, which has become a significant force in the technology industry.

The history of open source is deeply intertwined with the creation of the [GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html), initiated by [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) in 1983. Stallman envisioned software that was free in the sense of freedom, not just price, which led to the creation of a collection of software tools that could be freely used, modified, and shared. In parallel, communities started to emerge around specific technologies, such as the early [Linux](https://www.kernel.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) mailing lists of the 1990s and early 2000s. These online forums became places for passionate developers to discuss improvements, share ideas, and work together on open projects. The development of [Git](https://git-scm.com/), a distributed version control system, revolutionized the way these communities collaborate, effectively making Open source a mainstream paradigm.

This article explores several critical aspects of open source software, starting with the Open Source Development process, which examines how collaborative programming evolves and the methodologies that underpin it. Next, we will discuss the Advantages and Disadvantages of Open Source Software, providing a balanced view of its potential and limitations. A deep dive into Open Source Licensing will explain the legal frameworks that govern the use, distribution, and modification of open source software, with a particular focus on popular licenses such as the [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html) (GPL). This section will also address the [GNU Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/), an organization that continues to advocate for software freedom and oversees the GNU Project.

Lastly, we will examine how open source development is encouraged at the academic level, highlighting the activities of the [University of Florida Open Source Club](https://ufosc.org/about/), which fosters student engagement in open source communities and projects, helping to cultivate the next generation of open source contributors.

## Open Source Development
Early open-source development was driven by communities collaborating through [mailing lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel_mailing_list). Contributors proposed changes to projects by sending patches via email, and maintainers faced the challenges of managing conflicting submissions, code integration, and consistent distribution. The ethos of these forums emphasized openness, cooperation, and critique, but the manual patching process made merging cumbersome. This led to conflicts in versions and delays in development as maintainers struggled to integrate contributions smoothly​.

The introduction of tools like [BitKeeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper) marked a shift towards more efficient distributed development, enabling easier management of multiple branches. However, its proprietary nature (BitKeeper was closed-source) sparked tension in the open-source community. This ultimately led to [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) developing Git in 2005, a distributed version control system that revolutionized collaboration in open-source projects​. For a brief history Git's origins, we suggest reading the Linux Journal's [Git Origin Story](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/git-origin-story).

Git allowed developers to work independently on different parts of the codebase and merge contributions seamlessly, reducing the burden on maintainers. Today, projects like the Linux kernel rely heavily on Git for patch submissions, reviews, and code integration, ensuring smooth collaboration across thousands of developers globally.

## Understanding Open Source Licensing

Open source licensing plays a pivotal role in defining how software can be used, modified, and redistributed. The most influential licenses, including the [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) (GPL), emphasize the philosophy of [copyleft](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html) (a play on words of "copyright" in that it prioritizes user freedom instead of restrictive intellectual property rights). This principle ensures that any derivative work of a GPL-licensed project must also be distributed under the same license, thereby maintaining the freedom of the software across generations of modification. The GPL's underlying philosophy emphasizes the users' rights to run, study, modify, and share software freely.

In contrast, proprietary software refers to software that is privately owned and controlled by an individual or a company. The source code is usually kept confidential, and users are restricted from modifying, sharing, or distributing the software. Typically, users must purchase a license to use proprietary software, and the terms of this license dictate how the software can be used. Examples of proprietary software include Microsoft's [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows) operating system and Adobe's suite of applications, where users must pay for access and comply with strict usage terms.

The GPL is considered a strong copyleft license because any software incorporating GPL-licensed code must itself be GPL-compliant. By extension, any software derived from a GPL-licensed project must enforce the same user freedoms (right to run, study, modify, and share). Alternatively, the [GNU Lesser General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html) (LGPL) is a weaker copyleft license, allowing proprietary software to link to open-source libraries licensed under LGPL without requiring the proprietary code to be open-source as well. The lesser variant is intended for niche or low-barrier-to-entry applications where institutions that wish to circumvent the GPL's user freedoms may do so easily; simply put, it is lenient enough to incentivize institutions to use open-source software, even in cases where non-GPL alternatives are already widely available or where the cost of develop a proprietary solution is low.

On the other hand, permissive licenses such as the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit) and the [BSD License](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause) offer more flexibility. These licenses allow users to modify and incorporate the code into proprietary software, as long as the original copyright notice is maintained. The MIT and BSD licenses are popular in academia and industry for their simplicity and permissiveness, promoting widespread adoption and integration.

## Advantages & Disadvantages of Open Source Licensing

Open source software offers several advantages, particularly when licensed under the copyleft philosophy, such as that of the GNU General Public License (GPL). One significant benefit of copyleft is that it legally ensures software, along with its modifications, remains free and open for all users. According to the GNU Project, when developers improve a copyleft-licensed program, they cannot distribute it in proprietary form. Instead, they must either share it as free software or not distribute it at all. Most organizations, when faced with this dilemma, choose to release the improved version as free software rather than discard it. This ensures that the code and the associated freedoms (to use, modify, and redistribute) remain inseparable from the program's legal terms, fostering a culture of collective improvement and openness​.

GPL effectively ensures that user freedoms are protected, especially within large companies and projects. For instance, a legal case concerning Verizon had found that the company used open-source components within their networking devices but failed to provide access to the modified source code as required by the GPL (see [Wikipedia: Open Source Litigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_license_litigation)). Legal action was taken, and Verizon was compelled to release the source code to the public. This not only reaffirmed the legal power of the GPL but also ensured that Verizon's contributions remained accessible to the broader community, a key advantage of the copyleft model.

Another advantage of copyleft licenses is that developers can attribute copyrights to the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/) (FSF), the parent organization of GPL and the GNU project, which uses its legal resources to ensure that user freedoms are upheld. The FSF monitors for violations, taking legal action when necessary to ensure that GPL-licensed software remains accessible and open to the public.

However, open source software, especially under copyleft licenses, presents certain disadvantages. One of the primary challenges is its restrictive nature with regard to monetary interests. Since the code must remain open, developers cannot profit directly from selling proprietary versions of their software. Whilst charging for software is not prohibited by open source licenses, the freedom to distribute effectively means that users have the right to share free versions among themselves. As a result, free software developers often rely on alternative revenue streams, such as donations from patrons or charging for access to user or developer documentation. These methods can be unstable, especially for smaller projects without significant visibility or community backing​.

## UF Open Source Club
The University of Florida Open Source Club (OSC) is dedicated to fostering a collaborative environment for students interested in open-source software development. Founded in 2016, the club encourages problem-solving through open-source projects, aiming to contribute to both the local University of Florida community and the broader open-source ecosystem. All club projects are released publicly under nonrestrictive open-source licenses, empowering user freedoms by allowing anyone to use, modify, and distribute the software.

By hosting regular coding sessions, resume reviews, and hackathons, OSC provides students with hands-on experience in software development. It also promotes professional growth through leadership opportunities and networking events with tech companies. The club's mission aligns with the core principles of open-source software, ensuring that all contributions remain accessible and benefit the wider community, supporting the ethos of freedom and collaboration central to open-source development.
