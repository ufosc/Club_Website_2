A visual novel developed by the UF Open Source Club where players learn programming through a programming-language dating simulator. Players have the opportunity to interact with and date different programming languages, learning valuable knowledge in the process. Started in the Fall 2023, this game is built and maintained by club members.

More information on the game may be found on its dedicated website, [bytesoflove.net](https://www.bytesoflove.net). Similarly, if you'd like to contribute to the website, see the [BytesOfLove Website](../bytes-of-love-website)

## What's the Tech Stack?

The project uses the [RenPy](https://www.renpy.org/) visual novel engine, which is based on the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language. The RenPy engine exposes its own subset of Python, allowing developers to conveniently configure scripts for different features of the game.

## How do I Access the Source Code?

The project is completely open-source and its source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ufosc/VisualNovel). GitHub is a platform for version control and collaborative software development that uses Git to track changes in code, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously. At the Open Source Club, GitHub is used to host source code and publish issues. GitHub Issues are a feature that helps track tasks, bugs, feature requests, and discussions within a project. They allow developers to organize and prioritize work, facilitate communication, and plan project milestones effectively.
