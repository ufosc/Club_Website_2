OSC Workout App is a website that enables users to use it like it was an app without any cost. Inspired by many current workout apps that unfortunately cost subscriptions for better services, we decided on embark on a journey of building our own app. Users will be able to record their workouts.

This app will be written with a React frontend along with HTML/CSS and Node.js as the backend.

We plan to finish the app by Fall 2025!
