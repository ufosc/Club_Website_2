## Available now at [scheduler.ufosc.org](https://scheduler.ufosc.org/)

An open-source web app developed to help students at the University of Florida plan for classes next semester. SwampScheduler aggregates course and professor data from the UF-ONE API and uses it to generate permutations of different class schedules. Users enter their desired courses (with options to select from different professors or classrooms) and SwampScheduler generates a complete list of all possible class schedules.

## Features
- **Course Explorer:** Explore courses offered at the University of Florida. Find courses by *course code*, *title*, or *instructor*.
- **Course Selections:** Make multiple courses selections with backup options. Pick which classes you want (and remove which sections you don't).
- **Schedule Generator:** View and compare all the possible schedules and pick the one that fits your needs and wants. View color-coded schedules that show what your day-to-day struggle workload will be.

## What's the Tech Stack?

This project is built using a variety of exciting technologies, including:

- **TypeScript:** The JavaScript programming language with a typing system (for `Course` objects, etc.). Familiarize yourself with [TypeScript’s documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) to understand the basics and best practices.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces. The [official React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) is a great resource for learning about component-based architecture and state management.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework. Review the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for understanding utility-first styling and theming.
- **Vite:** Simply used as a build tool and development server. Learn how to set up, configure, and use Vite from [Vite’s official guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).
