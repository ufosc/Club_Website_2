Welcome to the UF Alarm Clock Project! This innovative alarm clock is designed to revolutionize your mornings by incorporating unique features to ensure you wake up on time and stay alert.

The goal of the UF Alarm Clock project is to create an alarm clock that not only emulates all the features of a traditional alarm clock but also introduces novel functionalities to make waking up a more effective and engaging experience. Our aim is to provide users with the ability to configure various punishments for not waking up and implement innovative methods for detecting if a user is awake, thereby promoting better sleep habits and ensuring timely awakenings.

## What's the Tech Stack?

The project uses [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) in conjunction with the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) programming language. NodeJS allows developers to execute server-side TypeScript code directly on their machines, as opposed to using an intermediary browser. Alarm clock also uses the [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) framework for developing cross-platform frontend interfaces. The [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app and accompanying framework are used to bundle the frontend and expose it as a mobile app in a sandboxed testing environment.

## How do I Access the Source Code?

The project is completely open-source and its source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ufosc/Alarm-Clock). GitHub is a platform for version control and collaborative software development that uses Git to track changes in code, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously. At the Open Source Club, GitHub is used to host source code and publish issues. GitHub Issues are a feature that helps track tasks, bugs, feature requests, and discussions within a project. They allow developers to organize and prioritize work, facilitate communication, and plan project milestones effectively.

## How do I Contribute?
