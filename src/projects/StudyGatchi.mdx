Combining the concepts of studying, gachapon, and Tamogotchi, Studygatchi is a productivity-focused Chromium/Firefox extension where you are incentivised to study to take care of a pet and to gamble for gifts and accessories for your pet. Study and stay on task to take care of your little goober guy or otherwise they die (in a variety of ways)! 

Inspired by gacha games such as Genshin Impact and Zenless Zone Zero, users will be able to roll for gifts, accessories, and furniture for their pet on an extendable pool of data where users can submit user-generated content on a seperate website. 

The goal? Improve productivity by gamifying the studying process. Studygatchi aims to detect if a user is on time during the allocated timer. When users are detected to be off-task, such as being on irrelevant and distracting tabs, they earn less rewards and risk their pet dying. By staying on task, you are able to keep your pet alive and happy!  Additionally, Studygatchi is equipped with a pomodoro timer to encourage breaks and efficient learning!

Studygatchi is built on a TypeScript/React frontend, Django/Python backend, and PostgresSQL database.
