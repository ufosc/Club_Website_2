Manim is a **Python library** for creating mathematical animations, originally started by Grant Sanderson as part of the [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) YouTube channel. The UF Open Source Club's Manim project is a fork of the original library that adds Computer Science related objects/structures like trees, heaps, etc. Many of the group's contributions have now made it into the original Manim codebase.

## How do I Access the Source Code?

The project is completely open-source and its source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ufosc/manim-data-structures). GitHub is a platform for version control and collaborative software development that uses Git to track changes in code, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously. At the Open Source Club, GitHub is used to host source code and publish issues. GitHub Issues are a feature that helps track tasks, bugs, feature requests, and discussions within a project. They allow developers to organize and prioritize work, facilitate communication, and plan project milestones effectively.

## How do I Contribute?

Contributions to the project's source code are accepted through its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ufosc/manim-data-structures). Please note that, since this is a fork of another repository, you'll need to open pull requests against the UFOSC repository and not the original Manim codebase.
