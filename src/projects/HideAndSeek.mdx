Hide and Seek is an app that lets you play hide and seek with your friends across the entirety of campus. Inspired by the fast-paced gameplay seen on the Youtube series Jet Lag: The Game, our app lets you run your own games of large-scale hide and seek with your friends!

In the game, seekers can ask the hider questions about their location, but this gives the hider curse cards, which can be used to slow down the seekers during their hunt.

The app is written with a React Native frontend with Supabase for the backend.

We plan to finish the app by the end of Spring 2025.
