The Bytes of Love website project is a static website, built using React, JavaScript, and NodeJS, for information on the UF Open Source Club's [Bytes of Love](../bytes-of-love) visual novel video game. It serves as a distribution page (hosting the latest releases of the game) and as a hub of information for the game.

The website may be accessed on [bytesoflove.net](https://www.bytesoflove.net). For the visual novel project, see [Bytes of Love project](../bytes-of-love).

## What's the Tech Stack?

The project uses [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) in conjunction with the [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) programming language. The website uses the [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) framework for bundling its [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) frontend.
