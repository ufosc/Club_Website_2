Jukebox is a web application that allows club members to manage songs in a collaborative [Spotify](https://spotify.com/) queue. It ports the functionality of a traditional jukebox to the modern era by leveraging the Spotify API. The Jukebox project also serves as an educational exercise for learning developer operations (DevOps) with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

## What's the Tech Stack?

The project is built using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) and the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) programming language. The frontend was developed using the [React](https://react.dev/) frontend library and the [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) framework. The backend is built with the [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#express) web server framework, the [Postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) SQL database, and the [Swagger](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) documentation generator.

Moreover, the project is deployed using [Terraform](https://github.com/ufosc/Jukebox-Server#), [AWS](https://github.com/ufosc/Jukebox-Server#), and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).
