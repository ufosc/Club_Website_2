Drone is a new hardware project that aims to create an autonomous 3D printed drone controlled via a wireless, handheld flight controller. The team's initial priority is to build a rough prototype and achieve dependable process control and navigation. Afterward, the team intends to experiment with full drone autonomy, 3D-topological mapping, or facial recognition. Members will be working with 3D computer-aided design (CAD) software, microcontrollers, embedded programming, telemetry & process control techniques, and ML/AI tools.

## Project Goals
- Create a 3D-printed drone from scratch that can be controlled via a wireless, handheld flight controller
- Incorporate a 3D-printed chassis with 4 motors, attached to 4 slave microcontrollers connected to a master microcontroller in the middle
- Implement an artificial intelligence model of some sort onto the master microcontroller
- Utilize the AI model for an unfinalized autonomous goal, such as returning 3D-topographical maps or identifying/counting people

## How do I get involved?
The best way to get involved with Drone is to communicate with the technical leads via [Discord](https://discord.gg/Gsxej6u) or at casual coding. There is no official repository for this project yet, but early documentation is available  [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wP9xJlF6QLjYobdwWyJt5TlRUdrPC1Gt1aDDJd_GyQ4/edit).
