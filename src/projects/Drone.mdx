Drone is a new and ambitious hardware project that aims to create an autonomous 3D printed drone from scratch.
Although the main autonomous goal is not decided, we're anticipating some large-scale ideas, such as attaching a camera to the drone and training an AI model to be able to scan what's below it, and return a 3D-topographical map of what it scanned.

The project is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to be a very exciting and impactful project.
Once the drone is able to fly in a stable manner, the opportunities are endless in terms of integrating AI/ML models to perform various tasks.

## Project Goals
- Create a 3D-printed drone from scratch that can be controlled via a wireless, handheld flight controller
- Incorporate a 3D-printed chassis with 4 motors, attached to 4 slave microcontrollers connected to a master microcontroller in the middle
- Implement an artificial intelligence model of some sort onto the master microcontroller
- Utilize the AI model for an unfinalized autonomous goal, such as returning 3D-topographical maps or identifying/counting people

## How do I get involved?
The best way to get involved with Drone is to communicate with the technical leads through the Discord or at casual codings.
There is no official repository for this project yet, but you can view the ongoing [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wP9xJlF6QLjYobdwWyJt5TlRUdrPC1Gt1aDDJd_GyQ4/edit)!
