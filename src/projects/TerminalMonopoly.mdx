TERMINALMONOPOLY is a rapid-pace, eclectic game which merges a classic board game with retro graphics, while satisfying the modern need of constant stimulation. Played entirely over a computer's command line, TERMINALMONOPOLY brings nostalgic feelings of ancient terminal games on the first computers, while ensuring anyone can play due to the minimal graphical and computing requirements.

TERMINALMONOPOLY is only 25% board game. Inspired by inane but hilarious Yakuza-type side quests, overcomplicated mechanics like in Cookie Clicker, and minigames such as those in Mario Party, TERMINALMONOPOLY has so much more to offer than just rolling dice.

TERMINALMONOPOLY is written entirely in Python. See [https://github.com/ufosc/TERMINALMONOPOLY](https://github.com/ufosc/TERMINALMONOPOLY)

An initial release of TERMINALMONOPOLY is expected to be completed by the end of Fall 2024.
