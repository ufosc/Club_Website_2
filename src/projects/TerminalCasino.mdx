Terminal Casino is a suite of popular casino games such as blackjack, poker, slots, roulettes, and more. The casino runs fully in terminal and will feature extensive customization options. Additionally we plan to support LAN/Local multiplayer. 

This game is a 100% Python project and is designed to be beginner friendly. We are always open to new ideas and new contributors!
